You're very familiar with the Linux operating system and UI operations. Now you need to use the Linux operating system to complete a mission. 
Your goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: {{video_width}}, video height: {{video_height}}, the overall mission is: "{{task_prompt}}".

We have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:
{% for item in sub_task_list %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

The current subtask is "{{current_task}}".
You can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:
```json
[
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"click","mouse_button":"left","mouse_position":{"width":int,"height":int}},
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"double_click","mouse_button":"left","mouse_position":{"width":int,"height":int}},
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"scroll_up","scroll_repeat":int},
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"scroll_down","scroll_repeat":int},
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"move","mouse_position":{"width":int,"height":int}},
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"drag","mouse_button":"left","mouse_position":{"width":int,"height":int}},
    {"action_type":"KeyboardAction","keyboard_action_type":"press","keyboard_key":"KeyName in keysymdef"},
    {"action_type":"KeyboardAction","keyboard_action_type":"press","keyboard_key":"Ctrl+A"},
    {"action_type":"KeyboardAction","keyboard_action_type":"text","keyboard_text": "Hello, world!"},
    {"action_type":"WaitAction","wait_time":float}
]
```
Where the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].


Please make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. 
My plan is to click the Start button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:
```json 
[
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"click","mouse_button":"left","mouse_position":{"width":10,"height":760}}
]
```

Another example, my plan is to open Notepad and I see Mousepad app on the screen, so my action will be:
```json
[
    {"action_type":"MouseAction","mouse_action_type":"double_click","mouse_button":"left","mouse_position":{"width":60,"height":135}}
]
```

{% if advice %}
Here are some suggestions for performing this subtask: "{{advice}}".
{% endif %}
The current subtask is "{{current_task}}", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.
